LagRunner - Game Development Project

Overview

LagRunner is a humorous 2D platformer game developed in Unity, designed as a parody featuring a character named Hitesh. Players navigate laggy levels, battle shinobi-style enemies, collect the powerful Shinobiggs weapon, and race to the finish line. This project showcases basic game development skills while embracing a lighthearted, chaotic vibe.

Features





Character Movement: Hitesh can move left/right and jump with intuitive controls.



Shuriken Combat: Collect the Shinobiggs to unlock shuriken-throwing abilities to defeat enemies.



Enemy AI: Jumping enemies challenge players across multiple levels.



Level Design: Customizable rooms with backgrounds and collectibles.



Parody Theme: A fun, lag-inspired twist reflecting development on modest hardware.

System Requirements





Operating System: Windows



Unity Version: Recommended 2020.3 LTS or later



Hardware: Minimum 8 GB RAM, NVIDIA GTX 1650 or equivalent

Installation





Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/yourusername/LagRunner.git



Open Unity Hub and add the project by selecting the cloned directory.

Project Structure





Assets/: Contains scenes (e.g., Level3), scripts (e.g., HiteshController.cs), and prefabs (e.g., ShurikenProjectilePrefab).



Prefabs/: Stores reusable game objects like the shuriken projectile.



Scenes/: Includes Level3 and potentially other levels.

Development Notes





Developed by [Your Name] as a learning project.



Optimized for low-end PCs (8 GB RAM, 4 GB VRAM) to reflect the "lag" theme.



Current version includes Level 3; additional levels can be added by duplicating and modifying scenes.

Known Issues





Occasional lag due to hardware limitations—part of the parody!



Shuriken collision may need tuning with complex level designs.

Future Improvements





Add more levels with unique challenges.



Implement sound effects and background music.



Enhance enemy AI for varied behavior.
